# Cash Register API
## Overview
This backend API is designed to simulate a cash register system, capable of handling items in a shopping basket and applying discounts during the checkout process. It is tailored to interact seamlessly with a frontend application, managing baskets via session-based storage with Redis, and ensuring real-time updates on item adjustments.

## Features
- **Session Management**: Utilizes Redis to create and manage sessions, associating baskets with unique session IDs.
- **Product Management**: Allows adding, updating, and removing specific products (Green Tea üçµ, Strawberries üçì, and Coffee ‚òïÔ∏è) from a basket.
- **Dynamic Discounts**: Supports Buy-One-Get-One (BOGO) and bulk purchase discounts, dynamically applied during checkout based on defined rules.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Ensures that each modification to the basket is immediately reflected, providing up-to-date basket contents and totals.
- **Checkout Process**: Processes checkout operations, returning an itemized receipt with applied discounts and the final total.

## Technologies Used
- **Rails**: Framework used to build the API.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database system for persistent storage.
- **Redis**: Used for session management and storing temporary basket data.
- **RSpec**: Used for testing to ensure reliability and correctness of the API functionalities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ruby (version specified in .ruby-version)
- Rails
- PostgreSQL
- Redis server

### Installation
1. Clone the repository and navigate into directory:

  ```

    bundle install
  ```

3. Setup the database:

  ```
    rails db:create db:migrate
  ```

4. Start the Redis server (ensure it's running on default port 6379);

  ```

**Checkout**
- *POST /baskets/:basket_id/checkout*
  - Finalizes the basket, applies any eligible discounts, and returns an itemized receipt with the total amount.

### Testing
Run the RSpec tests to ensure everything is working as expected:

  ```
